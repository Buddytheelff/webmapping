## Foundational Knowledge

While this book outlines the fundamental aspects of web cartography and visualization, including coding tutorials, it does assume a basic knowledge of programming concepts. 

- If you do not have any programming experience, we recommend first completing the [Learn How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) broad overview of programming concepts (~1 hour). 

- If you do not have experience with HTML or want a refresher, we recommend completing Lesson 1 (and only Lesson 1) of the [Introduction to HTML Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) (~1 hour). 

- If you do not have experience with CSS or want a refresher, we recommend completing Lesson 1 (and only Lesson 1) of the [Introduction to CSS Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) (~2 hours).

## How to Use this Book

This book and its resources can be downloaded directly from Github for individual use. Each Chapter folder contains the chapter content, as well as any data and files referenced.

If you're an instructor using Canvas (or a similar LMS), and want to incorporate  book materials directly into a course site, additional steps are necessary.

1. Download the book.
2. Convert Markdown files to HTML
    1. Each chapter contains one Markdown file with chapter content. To view this information in Canvas, it needs to first be converted to HTML.
    2. Use our [HTML-to-MD](https://uwcartlab.github.io/html-to-md/) tool to convert each Markdown file.
3. Upload HTML to Canvas page
    1. Create a new page in Canvas.
    2. In the top right of the editor, select "HTML Editor"'.
    3. Copy the selected HTML file into the page.
4. Repair image links
    1. Upload all Chapter images (stored in an "img" folder in each Chapter) to Canvas. 
    2. Now, each image will have its own URL on your canvas site.
    3. Replace the relative image links in the HTML with your new uploaded image links.
